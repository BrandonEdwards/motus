# motus
R package for users of data from http://motus.org

**Users**: the 'master' branch is what you want.  You can install it
from R by doing:
```R
    install.packages("devtools")              ## if you haven't already done this

    install_github("jbrzusto/motus@master")   ## the lastest stable version
```

**Developers**: the 'staging' branch is for work-in-progress.  Install it with
```R
    install.packages("devtools")               ## if you haven't already done this

    install_github("jbrzusto/motus@staging")   ## the development version
```
