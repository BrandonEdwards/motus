# motus
R package for users of data from http://motus.org

Users: the 'master' branch is what you want.  You can install it
from R by doing:
```R
    install.packages("devtools")              ## if you haven't already done this

    install_github("jbrzusto/motus@master")   ## the lastest stable version

or
    install_github("jbrzusto/motus@staging")  ## the version we're working on

```

## What's working so far:
